-- Query 1: Retrieve all customers who have placed an order in the last 30 days
SELECT DISTINCT c.*
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 30 DAY;

-- Query 2: Get the total amount of all orders placed by each customer
SELECT c.name, SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.name;

-- Query 3: Update the price of Product C to 45.00
UPDATE products
SET price = 45.00
WHERE name = 'Product C';

-- Query 4: Add a new column discount to the products table
ALTER TABLE products
ADD COLUMN discount DECIMAL(5, 2) DEFAULT 0.00;

-- Query 5: Retrieve the top 3 products with the highest price
SELECT *
FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 3;

-- Query 6: Get the names of customers who have ordered Product A
SELECT DISTINCT c.name
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
WHERE p.name = 'Product A';

-- Query 7: Join the orders and customers tables to retrieve the customer's name and order date for each order
SELECT c.name, o.order_date
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id;

-- Query 8: Retrieve the orders with a total amount greater than 150.00
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE total_amount > 150.00;

-- Normalization Step: Create order_items table and update orders table
CREATE TABLE order_items (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT NOT NULL,
    product_id INT NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id)
);

-- Update orders table to remove product details and link to order_items
ALTER TABLE orders
DROP COLUMN total_amount;

-- Query 9: Retrieve the average total of all orders
SELECT AVG(o.total_amount) AS average_order_total
FROM orders o;
